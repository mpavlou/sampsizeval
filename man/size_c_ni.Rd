\title{Precision-based sample size calculation based on the C-statistic (C) -
Numerical Integration}
\usage{
size_c_ni(p, c, se_c)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{(numeric) The outcome prevalence, a real number between 0 and 0.5}

\item{c}{(numeric) The C-statistic, a real number between 0.5 and 1}

\item{se_c}{(numeric) The required standard error variance of the estimated
C-Statistic}
}
\value{
n         The required sample size
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is to receive the anticipated outcome prevalence
, C-statistic and calculate the sample size to achieve the required precision
based on the C-Statistic. It uses Numerical integration and it assumes
marginal normality.
