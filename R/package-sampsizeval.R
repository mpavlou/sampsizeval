#' sampsizeval: Estimation of Required Sample Size for Validation of Risk
#' Models for binary outcomes
#'
#' The sampsizeval  function calculates the sample size required in the
#' validation dataset,  to achieve sufficient precision in the estimated
#' C-statistic, calibration slope and calibraiton in the large.

#' @section  Functions:
#' The 'sampsizeval'  function calculates the sample size required in the
#' validation dataset
#' to estimate the C-statistic (C), the calibration Slope (CS) and the
#' Calibration in the Large (CL) with sufficient precision. It takes as
#' arguments the anticipated values of the C-statistic and the outcome
#' prevalence (obtained, for example, from a previous study) and the required
#' standard error for C, CS and CL.
