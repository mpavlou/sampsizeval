Description: Estimation of the required sample size to validate a risk model for
    binary outcomes.For precision-based sample size calcucation, the user is 
    required to enter the anticipated values of the C-statistic and outcome 
    prevalence, which can be obtained from a previous study or expert knowledge.
    The user also needs to specify the required precision (variance) for the 
    C-statistic, the calibration slope and the calibration in the large.
