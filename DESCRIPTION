Description: Estimation of the required sample size to validate a risk model for
    binary outcomes.For precision-based sample size calcucation, the user is 
    required to enter the anticipated values of the C-statistic and outcome 
    prevalence, which can be obtained from a previous study or expert knowledge.
    The user also needs to specify the required precision (variance) for the 
    C-statistic, the calibration slope and the calibration in the large. The 
    calculations are valid under the assumption of marginal normality for the 
    distribution of the linear predictor. The
    default calculation for the C-statistic is based on the approximate formula
    which is very accurate for all values of C and p. For the calibration slope 
    and calibration in the large the formulae that use numerical intergration 
    are used.
