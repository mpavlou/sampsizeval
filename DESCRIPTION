Description: Estimation of the required sample size to validate a risk model for binary outcomes, based on the sample size equations proposed by Pavlou et al. (2021) <doi:10.1177/09622802211007522>. For precision-based sample size calculations, the user is required to enter the anticipated values of the C-statistic and outcome prevalence, which can be obtained from a previous study. The user also needs to specify the required precision (standard error) for the C-statistic, the calibration slope and the calibration in the large. The calculations are valid under the assumption of marginal normality for the distribution of the linear predictor.
